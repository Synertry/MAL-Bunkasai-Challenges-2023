## Motivation

My niche interest is to lookup the voice actors, when ever I watch a new anime. Escpecially if I can recognize the voice.
I also wanted to try a non-coding project, so I decided to solve this challenge.
It gave me insight, how to [aquire collaborators](Seiyuu-Scramble-Female-Edition/Sourcing.md), how to collaborate and some new tools.
