# Sourcing
___

Finding all solutions for the Seiyuu Scramble alone is too hard, so collaboration is the way to go to reach the needed 60 of 100 points.

## Sourcing channels

Where to look for collaboration.

### Discord

- Sun Palace
  - Club created on MyAnimeList, but not the official MAL Discord
  - The right goldilocks zone for sourcing, not affiliated with MAL, but still has a lot of users centered around MAL
- MAL
  - Official MAL Discord
  - Close to source of event, but can't properly source, because of moderation
  - High value targets in main event channels, because there are already involved in this event
- ida's Anime Cafe
  - Independent Discord server for Anime fans
  - As MyAnimeList is just a niche topic, there is not many users to source from


### MyAnimeList

Collaboration was found by clothes challenge thread [Whose Clothes Are Those?](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=2117798).
Users who posted in this thread are already involved in this event, so there is a high chance they are going to participate in the Seiyuu event as well.
Filtering criteria were:

- close to maximum points
- active in the last 24 hours
- high affinity to MAL (badges, etc.)
- High completed anime count > 200
- Optional: had female seiyuus as favorite
