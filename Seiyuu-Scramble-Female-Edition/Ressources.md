## Personal guidance


Identifying a Seiyuu is really hard, if they have a wide range of voices. Especially those who can do voiceovers for both genders.
That's why I recommend to look out for non-voice clues, like OSTs or sound effects.

What I mean by this is for e.g. S9C3 (Seiyuu 9 Character 3) you can hear the OST which is from Nisekoi, so the Seiyuu must be in the cast.
You can look them up on the anime page https://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi (scroll down) or the dedicated characters page of the anime https://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi/characters.

Other non-voice clues could be background noises, like the a caf√© or specific attack sound.

### Seiyuu characters

If you identified the Seiyuu or have a hunch who it could be, then
FK Studios on YouTube has a lot of Seiyuu character compilation videos in this playlist:

Hearing them back and forth can help you to identify the specific characters for this Seiyuu.
